# Calling-App-Using-Twilio
<p>This application is maven project and uses Twilio to make calls to customers in any country. You just need to enter the number you want make automated call.</p>
<br>
<p>Due to security I have messed with the phone number but you can add your own numbers. This number in "From" variable should be the number you bought from Twilio. It can be seen in the below screenshot that the call which I'm recieving is actually from "+1" country code and which is <b>United States</b>. If you want here what this call said you can <a href="https://github.com/Qamberhasnain/Calling-App-Using-Twilio/blob/master/WhatsApp.mp3">click here</a> and download the mp3 file to hear what it says.</p>
